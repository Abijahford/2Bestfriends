                <p>Abby(on the left) and Melina(on the right) originally met when they were about 4, they were next door neighbors growing up. <br> <br>
                    Their first encounter was initiated by Melina driving around in her pink Barbie Jeep. Abby noticed Melina from across the road and was intrigued by 
                    the toy car and the possibility of a new friend. Abby said to her mom, "Who is that girl? Let's go meet that girl." The rest was history and they formed a bond that won't ever be broken.
                Now that they're adults they're feeling ambitious and are eager to pursue their dreams. Starting a business is a huge milestone for them and a great stepping stone into their futures.
            They're reliable, hardworking, and their energy is contagious. They're so grateful for all their clients and look forward to meeting you</p>

                    <p>Hello, my name is Melina Johnson and I'm 20 years old. <br><br> I work part-time as a server in Mahtomedi, MN. Cleaning has always been very satisfying to me which is why I love 
                        it so much. I'd say I'm very detail-oriented while working on a task considering my favorite cleaning tool is a toothbrush. Outside of work I love to be outdoors!
                        I also enjoy spending time with my friends, family, and cat: Booger.
                    </p>

                    <p>Hi! My name is Abby Bloecker and I am 21 years old. <br><br> Aside from cleaning I am currently working part-time at the front desk at Planet Fitness 
                        and taking classes to become a personal trainer. I love to do yoga and read in my free time, as well as spend time with my mom and friends. Cleaning has always been one of my favorite
                    pass times and I am excited to turn that into a career and be able to help other people!</p>
